# A snow peak sighting forecast system named CDAQS-SPS  
## Part I Terrain Occulusion Checking based on DEM data
The program used in CDAQS-SPS for terrain occulusion checking was TOChecker.R, 250m DEM data was used to perform the checking over all Chengdu.
## Part II The Monte-Carlo simulation program of CDAQS-SPS
The Monte-Carlo simulation tool for CDAQS-SPS was MCSNOW.R, it generates random parameters for the threshold method used in the forecast system.
## Part III The core code of CDAQS-SPS
The core code of CDAQS-SPS was SNOWIDX.R, the method described in the paper was programmed.
